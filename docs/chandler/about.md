# About Chandler
[Chandler](https://github.com/openvk/chandler) is PHP-based web-framework/web-portal. By itself it's pretty useless, but you can install plugins/apps.

## Plugins
Plugins may provide a Web Application or be a library or hook.
Web Apps are mounted to a path like this: `/<id>` (where `id = app id`), but one app can be mounted to root.

## State of Chandler
This product is still in development phase, we are currently writing documentation/tests and API is going to change.
